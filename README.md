## 📖 About the Project

Legally Bad is a parody web interface designed to go against everything we know about good UX. Created by **Pearl Sikepe** and **Elena Ajayi** during NY Tech Week, this project flips usability on its head — for fun, frustration, and experimental learning.

## 😵 What It Does (Badly)

- **Reverse Cursor Movement**: Move your mouse right, the cursor drifts left.
- **Hidden Real Cursor**: Replaced by a hot-pink imposter.
- **Dodging "Start" Button**: Try clicking it. We dare you.
- **Popups**: Mildly antagonistic alerts that say “Nope.”
- **Sound Effects**: (Coming soon!) For the full sensory attack.

We built this inside a literal law office — **Jayaram Law** — so yes, it was *legally* bad in every sense.
